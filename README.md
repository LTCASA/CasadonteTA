Data Analytics Portfolio
1st project after completing a google data analytics course on coursera. Chose Cyclistic data set which is massive.
Tried to focus mostly on using R since that interested me the most.
Struggled getting my rmarkdown to render correctly but I finally got it after tons of searches online.
Findings on my project seemed thin to me so I will continue to do more case studies to develop those skills.
